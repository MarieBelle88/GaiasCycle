# Building Blocks

The Gaia Cycle platform is designed with modular components to ensure scalability, maintainability, and high performance. This document outlines the key building blocks of the system.

---

## 1. **Frontend**
- Developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, with **Bootstrap** for responsive design.
- Provides an intuitive interface for tracking sustainability metrics and managing data.
- Dynamically fetches and displays data through API integration.

---

## 2. **Backend**
- Built using **FastAPI**, a Python framework optimized for speed and reliability.
- Manages data validation, processing, and routing of API calls.
- Implements authentication, authorization, and security measures.

---

## 3. **Database**
- Powered by **MySQL**, designed for storing structured data efficiently.
- Handles scalability requirements to support large datasets related to user interactions and sustainability insights.

---

## 4. **APIs**
- Implements RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.
- Provides endpoints for:
  - **User management**
  - **Data submission**
  - **Real-time analytics**

---

## 5. **Third-Party Integrations**
- Uses **Twilio** for SMS notifications and communication.
- Integrates **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data, improving performance.
- Leverages **Ngrok** for secure external tunneling during development.

---

## 6. **Testing Frameworks**
- Backend testing with **pytest** for validation and performance testing.
- Frontend testing frameworks for UI consistency and usability testing.

---

## 7. **Deployment Tools**
- Uses **Docker** for containerization, ensuring consistent deployment across environments.
- Implements CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and delivery, streamlining updates.
