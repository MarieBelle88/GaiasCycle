# Coding Standards

To ensure consistent, maintainable, and high-quality code for the GaiaCycle project, the following coding standards and best practices must be adhered to:

## 1. Naming Conventions
- **Variables**:
  - Use descriptive and meaningful names that reflect GaiaCycle's domain (e.g., `user_feedback` or `vegetable_data`).
  - Use snake_case for variable names (e.g., `plant_growth_rate`).
- **Functions**:
  - Name functions in snake_case, starting with a verb to indicate action (e.g., `fetch_user_feedback`, `calculate_water_usage`).
- **Classes**:
  - Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `PlantGrowthManager`).
- **Constants**:
  - Use UPPERCASE with underscores for constants (e.g., `MAX_PLANT_CAPACITY`, `DEFAULT_GROWTH_RATE`).

## 2. Code Formatting
- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level for Python files and maintain consistent structure across all web development files.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 80 characters for Python and ensure a clear structure in HTML/CSS.
- **Spacing**:
  - Ensure proper alignment of Bootstrap components for UI consistency.
  - Maintain readable spacing in `.css` and `.js` files for smoother debugging.

## 3. Commenting and Documentation
- **Comments**:
  - Provide comments to explain logic in modules like `contactUs` or `plantMonitoring`.
  - Document any calculations or unique algorithmic implementations specific to GaiaCycle (e.g., soil moisture prediction).
- **Docstrings**:
  - Use docstrings for all public-facing Python functions and methods.
  - Example for GaiaCycle:
    ```python
    def calculate_growth_rate(soil_moisture, light_exposure):
        """
        Calculate the growth rate of a plant based on environmental factors.

        Args:
            soil_moisture (float): Percentage of moisture in the soil.
            light_exposure (int): Hours of sunlight exposure.

        Returns:
            float: Estimated growth rate per day.
        """
        return (soil_moisture * 0.4) + (light_exposure * 0.6)
    ```

## 4. Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully in user input forms like the **Contact Us** and **Feedback** pages.
- Validate and sanitize all user-provided data before saving to the database.
- Use clear error messages for user-facing issues (e.g., "Invalid email address format" or "Database connection failed").
- Example for GaiaCycle backend:
  ```python
  try:
      db_connection = connect_to_database()
  except ConnectionError as e:
      print(f"Database Error: {e}")
      log_error(e)
