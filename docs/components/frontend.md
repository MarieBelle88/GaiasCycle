# Frontend Components

## Overview

In this project, we leveraged multiple technologies to build an efficient and responsive frontend, integrating Jinja2, Uvicorn, Bootstrap, and FontAwesome icons. These tools enabled us to create dynamic, user-friendly web pages while ensuring scalability and maintainability.

## Uvicorn

**Uvicorn**, an ASGI server, was used to serve the application. It efficiently handles asynchronous requests, ensuring high performance when rendering frontend content. Uvicorn allows FastAPI to serve HTML templates and static content like CSS and JS to the user.

## Jinja2

For rendering dynamic HTML pages, **Jinja2** was integrated into FastAPI to generate templates. Jinja2 provided a flexible way to pass Python variables into HTML files, allowing us to render dynamic content such as user inputs, data from the backend, and templates with reusable components. This enabled a clean separation of concerns, ensuring that logic and presentation were maintained separately.

## Bootstrap

We used **Bootstrap**, a popular CSS framework, to quickly develop a responsive and modern frontend design. Bootstrap’s grid system allowed us to create a flexible layout for various screen sizes, while its built-in components such as buttons, navigation bars, and forms improved the overall user experience. Bootstrap’s pre-defined styles significantly reduced the development time and helped us maintain consistency across the web pages.

## FontAwesome Icons

To enhance the visual appeal and provide intuitive iconography, we incorporated **FontAwesome** icons. FontAwesome icons were used for various UI components, including buttons, navigation items, and content sections. They allowed us to visually communicate actions and features, improving accessibility and user experience.
