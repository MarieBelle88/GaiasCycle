## Understanding Virtual Environments
A virtual environment is required to isolate the project dependencies. You'll use Python's built-in virtual environment tool (`venv`) to manage this.

---

## Repository Access
Ensure you have access to the GitHub repository containing the project code. Contact the project admin if you encounter issues.
