## UI Design Principles

1. **Consistency**:
   - Uniform styling for components (buttons, fonts, colors) across all pages.
   - Consistent placement of navigation elements and action buttons to reduce confusion.

2. **Responsiveness**:

   - Uses flexible grids and scalable typography to ensure usability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Adheres to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.
   - Includes proper color contrast, alternative text for images, and support for screen readers.
   - Keyboard navigation enabled for key actions.
